# ThaiTank Battlegrounds
A python game based on [arcade package API](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/).


This project was made back in late 2019 as a part of Object Oriented Programming Course in Khon Kaen University.


This project was discontinued after the OOP course finished due to massive performance issues with Python so it is no longer playable with the current Arcade version. 
However, Arcade version 2.1.7, the version that this was made, should still be playable but be aware of massive performance issues.


The concept of the game was taken from a game called "Seal Hunter" where you have to eliminate enemies before they travel from one side of the screen to the other.
The players can upgrade their arsenal to deal with better threats as the game goes on. If the players manage to survive for 10 full waves, they win. Albeit the game seems simple,
the players have to move like a tank which means you can only move forward and backwards while side-directional inputs serve as rotating the tank to move in other directions.
